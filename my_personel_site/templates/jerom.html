          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My journey into data science began with a fascination for how data can unlock hidden patterns and drive decision-making processes. This curiosity led me to pursue formal education and self-directed learning in data science, where I have developed proficiency in tools and technologies such as Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that harness the power of data to make a meaningful impact.</p>
          <p>As I continue to grow in this field, I am excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals and tackle challenging projects that push the boundaries of what data science can achieve. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on and the skills I've developed along the way. Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
